    "laying out what your ideal sequence and duration of tasks might look like, the addition\n",
    "of [resources](http://taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/resource.html) (e.g. people, materials, infrastructure used, etc.) to tasks can help you\n",
    "determine if there are any limitations in the availability of those resources that might\n",
    "impact the planned project schedule. Also, costs can be associated with those resources, \n",
    "and [accounts](http://taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/account.html) established for capturing those costs for reporting purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration and exercise we will focus on assigning resources to tasks and \n",
    "developing an effort instead of duration-focused view of our project. We will also add\n",
    "some cost and revenue elements so we can link expended effort (and materials costs) to \n",
    "different project activities. \n",
